## Use Cases

**1. Student Council Elections**
  
 - Schools, colleges, or universities can use this to conduct student representative elections securely.

 - Unique codes ensure one vote per student without needing personal logins.

**2. Event-Based Audience Polling**
  - During live events, hackathons, talent shows, or debates, organizers can give attendees a code to vote for their favorite participants.

  - Quick and anonymous participation with real-time results.

**3. Internal Team or Organization Voting**
  - Perfect for small teams or companies wanting to vote on decisions (e.g., best project idea, team awards).

  - No login hasslesâ€”just distribute codes internally.

**4. Clubs or Community Groups**
  - Clubs (book clubs, hobby clubs, local communities) can vote on plans or leadership in a simple way.

  - Easy to run and manage even with non-technical participants.

**5. Remote Voting Scenarios**
  - Ideal for situations where voters are distributed remotely but a central admin manages the process.

  - Voters only need access to a browser and a valid code.

**6. Hackathons & Competitions**
  - Let participants vote on the best ideas or demos using assigned codes, preventing spam or multiple votes.
